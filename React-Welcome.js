WHAT IS REACT?
"React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
- React Docs 

React is a Javascript library, not a framework. What does this mean? A library provides methods 
and classes that will help you with your application design and control flow. A framework provides 
an application design and a control flow which will take your code and call it for you. React is a 
library, so it gives you the control and provides classes and methods that will help you. 

WHAT DOES REACT DO?
React's primary purpose is to help you render to the DOM. React makes it easy to put elements on the DOM, 
respond to user interaction, and change elements on the DOM only when they need to change. 

HOW DOES REACT DO THAT?
React has a tool called JSX - using JSX, you will write elements directly in your Javascript similar to 
how you write HTML. Using JSX, we could write something like: var div = <div></div>, something we never 
could have done in plain Javascript. With JSX, we can code the elements and the rules about how and when
 to render them, before they ever enter the DOM.

COMPONENT-BASED DEVELOPMENT
React excels at creating small components, or pieces, that fit together to make something bigger. 
Building with components makes it easier to test and find problems, easier to work with a group on the 
same project, and easier to make changes later. 
"Your components tell React what you want to render â€“ then React will efficiently update and render just 
the right components when your data changes." 1 In React, a page could be a component built of many smaller 
components which each handle different tasks. This way, anytime we need to change anything, we know exactly 
where to make the change, and the change will happen everywhere we use that component. 

THE VIRTUAL DOM
The DOM, or Document Object Model, is the structure of objects created by HTML. React stands between you and 
the DOM to make rendering simpler and to make performance better. React does this by working with a virtual DOM. 
"Think of the virtual DOM as React's local and simplified copy of the HTML DOM. It allows React to do its computations 
within this abstract world and skip the 'real' DOM operations, often slow and browser-specific.
"There's no big difference between the 'regular' DOM and the virtual DOM. This is why the JSX parts of the React code 
can look almost like pure HTML." 2
