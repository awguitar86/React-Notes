/*
STATE IN REACT
Components can each have their own state - a component's state is private data that it does not share with other components. 
This state is data that might change, and should help the component do its job. Learn in this video how to set a component's 
initial state in its constructor function. We'll also learn the first steps of treating state in React as immutable, and 
learn what that means. 

State
Components can have state or have no-state. The components that do have state will not share it with other components.
State is private.
State keeps track of things that change in a component.
State is some way of passing data.
